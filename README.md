# NLP_Reactor_Stabilization_to_Steady_State
This small project uses Gekko to find the optimal coolant flow on a heat exchanget to bring a batch reactor to steady state in the smallet posible time.
The result are stored and showed in three plots (Concentration, Temperature, Coolant Flow). I have aslo included a discretized solution solved in GAMS.
